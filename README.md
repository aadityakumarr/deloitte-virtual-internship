cyber security

A big news publication has revealed sensitive private information about Daikibo Industrials' – a production problem has caused their assembly lines to stop, threatening the smooth operation of supply chains relying on Daikibo’s products. The client suspects the security of their new status board may have been breached.

By completing this task, I learned how to read web log files, and how to identify spot suspicious requests. It turns out. For a little bit of context, the dashboard lives in Daikibo's Intranet. The only remote access to it would be through VPN tunneling. After navigating through the web log file, I noticed that the request of the user with the IP address of 192.168.0.101 starts off with a regular login and then browsing of the dashboard. But then it turns into a regular, once-per-hour automated check of the statuses in all 4 factories with no page resources being loaded and with obviously non-human punctuality.
